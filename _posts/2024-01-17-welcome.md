## Paper Discussion

Each discussion will be led by a small group of students, the discussion leads.
The leads will be responsible for:

- Reading the **entire paper** well-ahead of time.
  - You will only be lead a couple times during the course,
    so really diving into the paper is important.
  - Use all the resources at your disposal to understand the paper, 
    including your co-leads, the instructor, other references, 
    and the fact that you can start reading the paper well-ahead of time.
- Preparing a **reading guide** for the paper and submitting it to this website.
  - The reading guide should be a short document (1-2 pages)
    that summarizes the paper and highlights the most important points,
    as well helps the everyone else effectively read the paper in **1-2 hours**.
  - The reading guide should include a few **discussion questions**.
    - Class discussion is not limited to these of course,
      but they should help guide the readers as they go through the paper.
  - The reading guide is due **48 hours** before the discussion begins
    via pull request to this repository.
    - Go to the page for your discussion and click 
      the "Edit this page" link in the footer to create a pull request.

If you are not the lead, 
 you still must read the paper and the reading guide
 before the discussion begins.
You may of course start reading the paper early,
 but you may not have access to the reading guide
 until 48 hours before the discussion.
